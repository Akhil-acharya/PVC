# PVC
his project aims to develop a deep learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to automatically detect Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) in Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. PVCs are early heartbeats originating from the ventricles, often indicating potential cardiac abnormalities.
